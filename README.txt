OBJECTS

Implement four local random search algorithms, which are Randomized hill climbing (HC), simulated annealing(SA), genetic algorithm (GA) and MIMIC. Then, apply these algorithms to three discrete-value optimization problems. Finally,use HC, SA and GA on Neural Networks to find good weights for the NNs.
